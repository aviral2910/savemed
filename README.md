The application is the solution to the problem of wastage of medicines.
The idea is to built an app to allow proper distribution of unused medicines.
The app facilitates 3 logins and registration:-
1.Government Agency
2.Donor/Receiver
3.Pharmacy
There's also an option for Donation of medicines without login in case the donor is not willing to register on the app.

# ->The Government Facility
    It enables the government to take the expired medicines which can be used as Manure.Not all medicines can be used as
    manure. This facility will be available when there are large number of expired medicines so that proper use of medicines can be made in
    form of Manure.
  
# ->Donor/Receiver
    The donor is the person who donates the medicine and receiver is the person who will receive the medicine.

# ->Pharmacist
    The Pharmacist act as a mediator for our application as it facilitates transfer of medicine to receiver at a cheaper rate.

# Features of App
* The application keeps a check on distribution of medicines so that the pharmacist doesn't sell the medicine above 50% of the original cost
  of the donated medicine. This check will be incorporated with the help of QR Code verification on both ends; firstly between donor and 
  pharmacist and secondly between receiver and pharmacist.

* The application has separate dashboards for Government,Donor/Receiver and Pharmacy.
  * ->The Government dashboard would show the number of expired medicines available at some location.
  * ->The Donor/Receiver Dashboard incorporates
    * Facility to donate medicines.
    * List of medicines donated till date
    * Profile
    * Support - Contains option to contact us through email and phone and an option to report in case the pharmacist tries to sell the medicine at a higher rate.
  
  
  * ->The Pharmacy Dashboard incorporates
      * Facility to view medicines nearby
      * Sell medicines donated by the donor.
      * Medicine Exchange Verification.
      * Medicine Record
   
* The app will also have the FAQ-Frequently Asked Questions.
* The app works on Realtime database, therefore, changes done on one device are shown on another too. E.g- Registration of donor on one device and login on another.
# Future Aspects
    * This section would show the list of shortages of medicines along with the region. Therefore, asking the user in case he/she is willing to donate that particular medicine.
    * This type of donation will fetch the donor more reward coins.
    * Putting "Donated" stamp on medicines that are donated. This will provide double check on the pharmacist as it will not allow the pharmacist to sell the donated medicine at higher rate.
    * Enabling redemption of coins from partner pharmaceutical stores and diagnostic centers.

# Dependencies
  * Firebase
  * Internet Connection
  * Min. Android version- 4.0.3
  * Location
# Why Manufacturer will earn Royalty?
  * The manufacturer invested money during production of medicines. This money was spent on labour and capital and therefore when the medicine was first sold by the distributor or pharmacy, the manufacturer earns profit.
  * In case of redistribution of medicine, the manufacture has done no investment , therefore he's entitled to zero profit but royalty.
# Why Reward Coins are necessary?
  * Reward coins are a kind of promotion strategy, a reason for which a donor will donate medicines.
  * The collaboration with partner pharmaceuticals stores and diagnostic centers will enable the donor to redeem his coins by purchaing medicines or for medical tests.
  * The stores will collaborate with us in order to increase the traffic on their stores. Afterall who doesn't wants customers?
  * Reward Coins will therefore bind the donor with the app and he would not uninstall the app.
